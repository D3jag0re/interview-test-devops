# Coding Test 

Build a basic app that does _something_
Going to try and do one of each of the examples presented.

## Backing Up Databse and Send Output to Cloud Storage Solution

Will be doing this to backup a "dummy" DB stored locally up to an Azure blob. 

## Getting Some Information Back From an External Source and Presenting it to the End User

Uses Genuis to get lyrics for a song, removes articles, then displays the top 5 common words and their count.

Would like to turn all of these into a cmd line utility (using Click) where arguments can be passed right into the cmd line "for ex. lyrics.py -artist "Metallica" -song "One"" or if not put it it asks for both artist and song to be inputted.
