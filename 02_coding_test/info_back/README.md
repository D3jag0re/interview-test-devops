# Lyrics
This simple Python app gives the user two options and then retrieves the data.

Option 1 is to list top 3 songs of an artist sorted by popularity
Option 2 is to list the top 5 most common words in a song (not including words like I, me, you, and, the, etc.)

## Still TODO:

- [ ] Make opening a function
- [ ] Make Each option a Function
- [ ] Include an input error on selection
